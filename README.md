💼 Personal Resume Website with Easter egg.

This is my personal resume website — a single-page (or is it!?), responsive site built entirely with HTML and inline JavaScript, without any frameworks or build tools.
It showcases my experience, skills, projects, and contact information in a minimal, fast-loading format.
